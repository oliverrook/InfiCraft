InfiCraft - "Filled In"
(Also contains Rook Hooks in some child mods. See appropriate fork of TConstruct.)
This project aims to "fill in" some of the things I personally felt were missing from inficraft. Primarily, I felt that I was rather dissapointed by the small assortment of blocks in the infi-pack after it's major remake, and I guess I just didn't get the sensation of completeness, as some things were left out here and there.
Like some of the doors are missing, and that TConstruct won't accept high cobblestone as a material.
So, here's the list of additions I want to make to give this mod the support it needs to live up to it's name and potential:
- Add objects for each of the cobblestone pastels and depths.
- Finish the different doors (aka. fix vanilla to make it InfiCraft)
- Rinse and Repeat the above until combinations are completed, or give up and put in a custom renderer/auto-combination generator.
- Make it so there is more things you can use as materials for TConstruct.
- Modify TConstruct renderer to deal with colors of wood and stone
- Make sure that there is a combination generator or modular system or similar by the time I start as It suddenly seems like more textures than it's worth to recolor and more indiviudal damage values than the Pixel Artist XtrabBlocks Mod is worth in 16-bit.
- I'll figure it out later.
