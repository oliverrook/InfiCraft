InfiCraft - Name to be determined
(Also contains Rook Hooks in some child mods. See appropriate fork of TConstruct.)
This project aims to "fill in" some of the things I personally felt were missing from inficraft. Primarily, I felt that I was rather dissapointed by the small assortment of blocks in the infi-pack after it's major remake, and I guess I just didn't get the sensation of completeness, as some things were left out here and there.
Like some of the doors are missing, and that TConstruct won't accept high cobblestone as a material.
This is the current plan (due to constant and highly varying frequency change):
Add and change all items and blocks to match their base materials, ie if it's made of high cobble, it will be lighter than the cobble one.
To do this: Use custom render system combined with a multi-damage value array system, which will be parsed in the background to determine the render's display, so the base code will not be affected.
