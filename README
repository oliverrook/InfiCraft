◊◊◊◊◊◊◊mDiyo!◊◊◊◊◊◊◊ I'm spamming this because I want you to read this!

Feel free to help me along with some of these! A Custom Renderer for the Infi-pack maybe? Please?
And I can do the rest of the tedious stuff? You know, since you already have a renderer for Tinker's Construct?
And because it would be a very nice gesture to make this less pain staking for me.
I'll give you some free room in your inbox for it! ^^

This is a mod that patches up some of the missing parts to InfiCraft, and also adds in a few "Rook Hooks", which are
basically my way of connecting mods together via their apis, or source code, and making them go from compatible to
supported.

List of things to fill in:
