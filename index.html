<h2>Modular Infinity</h2>

<h2>By - Oliverrook</h2>

<p>This mod is a complete rewrite of the InfiCraft Pack or InfiPack for those who prefer it. I have recieved confirmation from mDiyo that I may make this rewrite, and that I can even make a whole new official version of it.
  This mod will make InfiCraft Modular and give it an API and Custom Renderer, so that all combinations of blocks will be possible with the ability for Mod Authors to add in their own modules. This system will make it so that colored bricks may be turned into colored brick slabs, stairs, and so on, without the need for putting in all 712 individual entries for the basic properties. Finally, it will check for recipes that use a material added by this mod, and change them to support the colored varients.
  The "Rook Hooks" are simply a part of the mod that links to another mod I will be working on. The purpose of the mod is to link together mods that all ready are compatible, and take them up to the next level, at which they will support each other even farther then forge could allow. It will take down the boundries seperating mods that could be one.</p>

<p>Features:<div id=".features">
  Now Modular, so things can be turned on and off, as well
  as changed.
  Runs of Properties so every block that normally can be
  made with the material, can now be made with InfiCraft varients.
  Mods in the pack now interact and flow better.
  Allows for use of InfiCraft blocks and items to be used with
  other mods.
  Rook Hooks for this mod.
  Downloadable Rook Hooks for other mods.
